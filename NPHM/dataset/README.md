# NPHM Dataset


## Requesting Access

Due to its sensitivity our data is restricted for research purposes only!  
You can request acces to our data [here](https://forms.gle/mGRrYm9ovPuvjeky6), after carefully studying and signing the terms of service.

## Example Usage

To get started with the dataset we provide a small dummy dataset [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1kfMRUnWxISaYQhqZxgDqakz4358VnS7k?usp=drive_link).
Once downloaded, place both folders in `dataset/dummy_data/dataset/` and `dataset/dummy_data/single_view/` respectively.

Furthermore, you can run the simple script

```
python scripts/dataset/example_usage.py
```

which demonstrates how to use our simple `DataManager` class and provides some simple means of visualization.
The comments in the script provide descriptions of the plotted data.
